strategy: Evolving to a Multi-Tenant SaaS PlatformTo sell this platform to multiple companies, we must ensure that each company's data is completely separate and secure. This is known as multi-tenancy. We will also implement a robust authentication system so that only authorized administrators from a company can access their specific data.Here is the strategic plan to re-architect the application.Phase 1: Database and Schema RedesignThe foundation of multi-tenancy is the database. We need to associate every piece of data with a specific company.Create a companies Table: This new table will store information about your clients.CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS companies (    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);Create an admins Table: This table will replace the concept of a single "admin". Each admin will be linked to a specific company.CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admins (    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,    company_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'admin', -- For future role-based access    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE);Update Existing Tables: We must add a company_id to the jobs and interviews tables to link them to a parent company. This is the most critical step for data isolation.Alter jobs table: Add company_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL and a foreign key constraint.Alter interviews table: Add company_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL and a foreign key constraint.Phase 2: Implement a Robust Authentication SystemWe will build a secure login system for admins.Add New Libraries: We will need to install libraries to handle authentication and password security.pip install Flask-Login Flask-BcryptCreate Authentication Routes: A new file, app/routes/auth_routes.py, will be created to handle all authentication logic:/login (POST): Will verify admin credentials (email and password)./logout (POST): Will log the user out./register (POST): A new flow for a company to sign up, which will create a company and a primary admin record.User Session Management: We'll use Flask-Login to manage user sessions. Once an admin logs in, their id and company_id will be stored securely in the session, allowing us to use this information in all subsequent requests.Phase 3: Make All Backend Logic "Tenant-Aware"This is the most extensive part of the refactoring. Every single database query must be updated to include a WHERE company_id = ?%20clause%20to%20ensure%20an%20admin%20from%20Company%20A%20can%20never%20see%20data%20from%20Company%20B.Example%20Change%20in%20admin_routes.py:Before:cursor.execute(%22SELECT%20*%20FROM%20jobs%20ORDER%20BY%20created_at%20DESC%22)After:from%20flask_login%20import%20current_user#%20...company_id%20=%20current_user.company_idcursor.execute(%22SELECT%20*%20FROM%20jobs%20WHERE%20company_id%20=%20%s%20ORDER%20BY%20created_at%20DESC%22,%20(company_id,))This%20tenant-aware%20filtering%20will%20be%20applied%20to%20every%20database%20query%20in%20manage_jobs,%20get_admin_interviews,%20get_admin_interview_detail,%20etc.Phase%204:%20Frontend%20UI%20for%20AuthenticationTo%20support%20the%20new%20backend,%20we%20will%20need%20new%20HTML%20pages.login.html:%20A%20new%20page%20with%20a%20form%20for%20admins%20to%20enter%20their%20email%20and%20password.register.html:%20A%20new%20page%20for%20new%20companies%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20the%20service.Update%20admin_dashboard.html:%20The%20dashboard%20will%20now%20be%20a%20protected%20resource.%20If%20a%20user%20is%20not%20logged%20in,%20they%20will%20be%20redirected%20to%20the%20login.html%20page.This%20plan%20outlines%20a%20complete%20architectural%20overhaul%20that%20will%20transform%20your%20project%20into%20a%20secure,%20multi-tenant%20SaaS%20application,%20ready%20for%20the%20market.%20Once%20you%20approve,%20we%20can%20begin%20implementing%20these%20changes,%20starting%20with%20the%20database%20and%20backend%20logic.
